## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

In order to run the code you should count with the following libraries: pandas, numpy, seabor, matplotlib,
harversine and folium

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Seattle Airbnb Data to better understand:

1. What is the most expensive time of year to rent an Airbnb listing in Seattle?
2. What is the top 10 most expensive neighborhoods?
3. What is the relationship between the distance to downtown Seattle and the price of an Airbnb listing?

The full set of files are available in kaggle platform on the following link:

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook called "project1.ipynb" where you can find the step-by-step process I made in order to answer the
previously mentioned questions

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code are:
1. Seasonality affects price and particularly during summer the price reach the maximum.
2. By far, Faimount Park is the neighborhood with the highest average listing price overcoming the industrial district (2nd place) by 100 USD.
3. As you move away from the business district the listing base prices tend to decrease.

Must give credit to Airbnb open data and kaggle for making available the datasets.
